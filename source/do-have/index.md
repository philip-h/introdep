title: Do I have it?
---
Upon research, the current consensus seems to be if a constant (by constant, I mean that it occurs for most of the day) depressive mood continues for two weeks or more, this may very well indicate major depressive disorder. As alluded to in the introduction, depression can take on many forms outside of feeling sad. Depression can cause a disinterest in things that were once enjoyable: hanging out with friends, hobbies, or even favourite foods. Sleep could also be an indicator of depression: getting too much sleep, or not enough of it. Feelings of worthlessness or despair, usually about the past, are also common. 

Depression could also strip one of their ability to feel anything at all: forget happy or sad, lonely or loved - just numb. This, among other factors, can also lead to thoughts and actions of suicide. 

If after reading the above paragraph, and reading the article linked below, you believe you may have depression, then please **seek professional help**. That is, and will be, my only personal, original thought in this entire website.

This article, written by an Associate Professor of Psychiatry at Icahn School of Medicine, deals with the issue of knowing if one has depression. The contents of this article can be found in many other documents, articles and sites on the internet, once again proving the article’s legitimacy. Furthermore, this article was published through the Anxiety and Depression Association of America. I chose this specific article because, rather than stating vague symptoms such as, for example “change in mood”, it provides many real life examples of scenarios and situations that would be common for someone dealing with depression: “major depression also includes a … lack of pleasure in usually enjoyed activities where the individual just doesn’t feel like … eating favourite foods (they just don’t taste as good anymore).” This article could be helpful for anyone who believes they might be suffering from depression, or discerning whether a loved one may also be struggling with depression.
