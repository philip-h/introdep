title: Is it curable?
---

To say there is a cure for depression is to say that anyone who struggles with depression can go to the doctor, follow his or her instructions, and never have to worry about depression again. So, in that definition, no, there is currently no “cure” for depression. There are, however, many possible treatments for depression. Some treatments lower the symptoms of depression, others attempt to amend the root cause of depression (which, may I remind you, are not entirely certain as of yet). Treatments for depression are often broken down into three broad categories: Pharmacological treatments, Psychotherapy, and Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT). All of these treatments come with their own bundle of side effects and success rates. It’s important to note that depression is as unique as the individual: simply because one method of treatment worked for one struggling with depression, does not necessarily mean it will also work for you.

There are also new methods (such as that neurogenesis thing mentioned before) that are being researched. As technology advances, and we are able to study the brain more effectively, depression will become more manageable. 

The best person to ask about what treatment might be best for you is always a professional. Doing your own research is important, but so is ensuring you get the help you need!

This article, published through the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, broadly lists possible treatments for anyone struggling with depression. It clearly explains each category of treatment, gives examples, and importantly, lists the sources of their information. The language used is also important; at no point does the article claim there is a “cure” for depression, but merely lists the current possible treatments that may, or may not work. The information in the article is very consistent with other articles found on the internet, and in published journals. This article could benefit anyone interested in understanding the process of treating depression, whether or not one is currently struggling with depression.
