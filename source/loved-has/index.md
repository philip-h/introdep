title: My loved one has it.
---

Perhaps you are someone like me. Perhaps you are fortunate enough to have never struggled with depression, but you have friends or loved ones that do. If that is the case, then I thank you because you have already taken the first step to helping your loved one: you are trying to educate yourself on the realities of depression. The first article I am listing is a great read by an Australian organisation called ReachOut. For brevity, I will list the six points the article mentions, but I highly encourage you to read the entire article!

1. Become informed
2. Be there to listen
3. Take their feeling seriously
4. Let them know about support services
5. Respond to emergencies
6. Take care of yourself

The second article tries to approach this topic in a very similar way, but fails in some regards. I am including this article on my website to illustrate a point: not-great information can be very easily found and taken as truth. The second article also lists the idea of becoming informed as its number one way to help a friend struggling with depression. Some other points are questionable. Please be careful researching this topic.

This article lists six ways to help a friend with depression. I was hesitant to use this article due to the fact that it was not published by a medical journal, or presumably by a PhD holder (the author is not mentioned in the article). Upon researching, I learned that reachout.com is a leading online mental health organisation that has been serving their community for over twenty years. I chose this article because it deals, very eloquently, with some harsh realities that one might face trying to help a friend with depression. I noticed these details missing from many other web pages discussing similar topics. This article is targeted at those who have friends and family that struggle with depression, but suitable for anyone trying to develop a deeper understanding of the complexities of depression.

I chose to reference this article to illustrate how easy it is to be misled by sites on the internet. This article has a very similar structure to the above article, and even contains valuable information; however, many of the “Ways to help a friend for family member with depression” are questionable at best. For example, the sixth way to help is to “make them smile”; many online resources stress that depression is much more than just feeling sad, and attempts to “make” depressed people smile not only doesn’t help many situations, but can often hinder them - as if someone struggling from depression wouldn’t smile all the time even if it made an iota of a difference. I would not recommend anyone seriously looking to help a loved one with depression to take this article too seriously.
