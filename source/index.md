This is the first question you need to ask yourself before you continue browsing. If you are here to learn more about depression, whether or not you think/know you have it, then you have come to the right place. If you, for whatever reason, have no interest in learning more about the realities of depression, then you will not enjoy this website in the slightest, but you are still welcomed to stay!

I should preface that I am not a medical doctor, psychiatrist, or anyone of the sort; just an aspiring teacher. I also have never suffered with depression myself, and I will never claim to truly understand anything about the matter. But, I do have loved ones that struggle with it, so this site is as much for myself as it is for you.

A lot of the information on the internet about depression can seem true, but in reality be very false, so this site aims to provide only the best and truest information. Throughout this site, I have curated articles, academic journals and even cartoon stories, all in an attempt to educate myself (and maybe you too) on the realities of depression. I will begin by summarizing the article in layman's terms, and below there will be a link to the article, and why I chose that specific article. I have done some research and talked with my loved ones that struggle with depression to ensure that the content on this site is true. 

If, through this site, you discover that it’s possible that you may have depression, then please, **seek professional help.** And always know that, even if your feelings don’t work properly, that there’s a random stranger out there on internet land that loves you.

Last thing to note: if you are somewhat annoyed at the vagueness of the page titles and the links (all of the items that are big and visible) then that’s a good thing. When talking about depression, it can be tempting to refer to depression as “it” or “... you know, that thing I/you struggle with.” 

**Give it a name!** 

Knowing something’s name gives you power over it. Saying something’s name demystifies it, puts it in the light, and presents possibilities of more people listening.
