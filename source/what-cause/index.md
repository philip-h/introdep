title: What causes it?
---

 Here’s the long and short of it: we don’t really know for sure! What I mean is that doctors can’t just say “So depression is caused by this, this, and that, so here, take this pill that fixes this, this, and that.” However, through lots of research we have come a long way. Researchers have identified genes that make individuals more vulnerable to low moods and they have learned that certain parts of the brain, specifically the amygdala, the thalamus, and the hippocampus also affect mood. In fact, current research shows that the hippocampus is actually smaller in some depressed people, and researchers are looking for links between low moods and slow productions of new neurons from the hippocampus. 

Early research suggested that depression was caused by a lack of [serotonin](https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/serotonin) production (it’s a chemical that, among many other things, regulates mood), so the patients were prescribed antidepressants. What was strange was that many patients experienced some relief of some symptoms of depression, but only after a few weeks. Current research suggests that antidepressants may also encourage production of new neurons (neurogenesis), which may explain a few things!

There is also current research done into gene’s effect on depression, along with stress, early losses and  trauma and, SAD (Seasonal affective disorder).

This article, published by Harvard Health Publishing, dives deeper into what the possible root causes of depression could be. Very importantly, the beginning of the article debunks a common myth that depression is just a chemical imbalance in the brain. I chose this article because the author was not afraid to go beyond the general introduction of depression and use the esoteric terms associated with depression (while also providing excellent explanations of such terms). This article should be read by anyone who wants to acquire a deeper understanding of what the current research says about the onset of depression.
