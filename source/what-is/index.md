title: What is it?
---

Depression, or major depressive disorder, can be difficult to articulate or define; it is much easier to say what depression is not.

Depression is not simply feeling sad. 
Depression is not the same as grieving. 
Depression is not the same for everyone. 
Depression is not some excuse to get out of a test at school.
…

It is difficult to define what depression is without going into its symptoms, possible causes, current treatment options and so forth. However, the [American Psychiatric Association](https://www.psychiatry.org/) states that depression not only negatively changes the way you feel, but also the way you think and act. Depression can cause feelings of sadness, or even a loss of interest in things you used to enjoy. Depression can create physical and emotional problems, and also lower someone's ability to function in their day to day lives.

If you are looking for a way to try to intuitively understand what it’s like to have depression, then read these two posts. I won’t describe them here, I feel that would do them injustice - just read.

[What Is Depression - psychiatry.org](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/depression/what-is-depression)

This web page is a great introduction into what depression is, and also some things it is not; it touches on major issues, such as the fact that “depression is different from sadness” and even what depression can manifest itself to look like. I chose this specific web page because it is very beginner friendly, and suitable for anyone to form a first or early insight into what depression is. All of the information on this website also correlates with many other web sites and documents found on the internet that cover depression, so I would argue that the information on this website is credible, not to mention the fact that the website is from the American Psychiatric Association.

This is not an article, a published journal, nor was it written by a professional researcher; it is a story told through by someone who struggles with depression. This blog post, as I will call it, attempts to explain, with pictures and words, what it is like to transition from being mentally healthy to struggling with depression. This blog post is an amazing read for anyone trying to learn more about depression in a very personal, anecdotal manner.
